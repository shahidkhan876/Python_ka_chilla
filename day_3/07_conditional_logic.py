#logical operator are either "true or false " or "yes or no" or "0 or 1"
#equla to ==
#less than <
#greater than >
#less than and equalk to <=
#greater than and equal to  >=

#is 4 equal to 4?
# print(3==4)
# print(4<=4)
# print(4>=4)
# print(4!=4)
# print(4>4)
# print(4<4)

#application of logical operators
# ahmad_age = 4
# age_at_school = 5
# print(ahmad_age == age_at_school)

#input function and logical operator
age_at_school = 5
ahmad_age =input ("how old is ahmad") #input function
ahmad_age = int(ahmad_age) #converting string to integer
print(type(ahmad_age))
